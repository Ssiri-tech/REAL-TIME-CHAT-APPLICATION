#REAL-TIME CHAT APPLICATION

COMPANY: CODETECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME: SANGISHETTY SIRI

INTERN ID:CT04DN800

DOMAIN: FRONT END DEVELOPMENT

DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH


In the second week of my internship at Codetech, I worked on building a Real-Time Chat Application. This is a small web app that allows two or more people to chat with each other instantly, just like WhatsApp or Messenger.The main goal of this task was to understand how real-time messaging works using web technologies. When one person sends a message, the other person can see it immediately without refreshing the page.
In this real-time chat application, two users can open the chat app in their browsers and start chatting instantly. When one user types a message and clicks the "Send" button, the message is sent to the server. The server then immediately sends the message to the other user, and it appears in their chat box without any page refresh. This real-time communication is possible using Socket.IO, which creates a live connection between the client and the server. From this task, I learned how to create a simple chat application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and Socket.IO. I understood how real-time communication works, how to connect frontend and backend, and how to run a Node.js server to manage message flow between users.

Technologies Used:

HTML: To create the structure of the web page

CSS: To make the page look nice

JavaScript: To handle actions like sending messages

Node.js: To run the server (backend)

Socket.IO: To send and receive messages in real-time
